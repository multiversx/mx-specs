## Purpose
Our CDO was created early this year and we send our Discord verified holders monthly rewards in LKMEX.

To farm LKMEX on the DEX we have been using this address 
https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd14g90e39lylknqt32uwk0dde0u6fdr95vvk7wg5d89w9myd5mn5lq3zl7e2
and for distribution we use this address
https://explorer.elrond.com/accounts/erd195sm9czu7ufa9373plj4ku5ny2vne0jt0gquu4m8fr0n3nw9gsgqagatj2

We started distributing LKMEX on 14th March this year and done it monthly ever since.

## Address of Smart Contract

## Number of users
## Average LKMEX used during the previous month

Our last distribution was on 18th October and we distributed ~3M LKMEX to 209 users. Our next distribution will happen these days and it will have ~6M LKMEX, as we turned the LKMEX farm into a LP and have greater rewards. We expect the farm to produce even more next month, around 8M at least.

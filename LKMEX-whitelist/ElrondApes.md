## Name of the project

ElrondApes

## Description of the project

ElrondApes is a collection of 10,000 uniques NFTs on the MultiverseX blockchain.

Website: https://elrondapes.com/

## Purpose

Our dApp (https://app.elrondapes.com/) currently provides a dashboard collection metrics, a community map and a staking feature. Basically, by staking your ElrondApes NFT into our contract, you're receiving LKMEX token as weekly rewards. These rewards come from a percentage of the sales royalties and the farming on the pool EGLD/USDC. We're internally discussing about changing the reward token, since the LKMEX will become non transferrable soon. We need to be whitelisted since stakers have not claimed their rewards from the contract yet.

## Purpose
We send to our holders monthly rewards with LKME.

To farm XMEX on the dex we use our CDO wallet, which takes 50% of all royalties and earnings from our services. We provide web3 development services, JewelSwap and sell our Shopify apps.

To qualify all eligible addresses we use our first open source script, which was actually instrumental in developing Elrond ecosystem.

## Description of the project
HodlTokenClub is an web3 organisation focused on capturing yield on xExchange and share it with its investors. We leverage MultiversX NFT's to distribute $HODL token (share of our net worth) and rewards generated on xExchange. 

## Purpose
We have build economic model enabling Comunity Farm growth on xExchange and generating incentive for new users to join, mint our NFT's and contributing to our ecosytem to grow as well as LKMEX rewards to grow in value as more capital is captured from minting process. Community farm is 100% own by $HODL token owners. Rewards are distributed everyday via #GiveawayEveryday scheme on Twitter. Over 4mths we distributed over 90 Million LKMEX to our Community members, eductaed them and helpped with farming on DEX. We belive we add value to entire MultiversX ecosystem as our project is solely based on capturing Yield on xExchange, growing our position and sharing part of it as rewards with community members and helping them with finding optimal strategy for their own farm. Our Yield generated in LKMEX never was sold and never will. All LKMEX rewards coming from Founder personal farm, to enable Community fam growth while capturing capital from our NFT minting process. Until 30/10/200 LKMEX rewards were sent directly from Founder ERD and from 31/10/2022 Founder Staking Farm was merged (473,324,919.39 LKMEX) with Community Farm to benefit Hodlers and offset LKMEX rewards decline due to APR drop.

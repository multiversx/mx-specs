Description of the project
XOXNO Marketplace / NFT Staking

Purpose
Our NFT Staking contract provides a single entry point for multiple creators and users where the creators are locking LKMEX for a period of time with daily issuance as rewards to be claimed by the users who staked their NFTs.

We are the only NFT Marketplace supporting trading with LKMEX, users list their NFT for a specific amount and other people can BID/BUY the specific NFT/SFT.  NFT trading in LKMEX is not going to affect the new economics or the price.
